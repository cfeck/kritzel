### About

Sample Qt5 application that uses the cellwriter engine to
recognize handwritten characters.

### Training

The cellwriter application must still be used to train.
Alternatively, copy file "profile" into "~/.cellwriter"
before characters can be recognized, but this will only
work for my handwriting style.
